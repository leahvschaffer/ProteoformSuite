\section{Top-Down}

\subsection{Overview}
On this page, the top-down hit results are read in from the file(s) loaded under Top-Down Hit Results on the Load Results page. A top-down hit is a proteoform spectral match. Top-down hits are then aggregated into top-down  proteoforms by identification and retention time. The theoretical database is supplemented with top-down proteoform identifications not already present in the database. Bottom-up peptide results are integrated with the top-down proteoform results.

\subsection{Run Page}
\begin{itemize}
\item Load top-down results file(s) on the Load Results page under Top-Down Hit Results (see \textbf{Load Results} section)
\item Set all parameters as desired for current analysis (see below)
\item Click Run Page button (top right)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Set Parameters}

\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{figures/topdown1.jpg}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Min. C-Score: the minimum C-score\supercite{LeDuc2014} for TDPortal results required for a top-down hit to be included. C-scores of 3 and higher correspond to identified proteoforms and C-scores of 40 and higher correspond to well-characterized proteoforms
\item Ret. Time Tolerance (min): retention time tolerance used for aggregated top-down hits of the same proteoform identifications. Top-down hits of the same ID that elute outside of this tolerance will be aggregated into separate top-down proteoforms
\item Tight Absolute Mass: if checked, TDPortal hits from the Tight Absolute Mass search will be included
\item Biomarker: if checked, TDPortal hits from the Biomarker search will be included
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Top-Down Hits: total number of top-down hits (proteoform spectral matches)
	\item Unique PFRs: unique proteoform identifications
	\item Top-Down Proteoforms: number of aggregated top-down proteoforms. May be greater than the number of unique PFRs if some hits of the same ID fall outside of the retention time tolerance
	\item Table Filter: filter the Top-Down Proteoforms table (left) by any entered text

	\newpage
	\item Top-down Proteoforms table: the left table displays all top-down proteoforms. For MetaMorpheus results, ambiguous identifications in a single top-down proteoform have information separated by a "|".
